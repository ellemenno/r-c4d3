The arcade project source is organized at it upper level by subsystem:

framework      Code to make writing games a little easier
installation   The R-C4D3 system in a precompiled package
menu           Front end for the R-C4D3 system; shows game icons and launches games
menushell      Desktop executable web broswer shell that loads the menu.html
romloader      Reusable loader for IGameRom implementors that encapsulates control and score access
roms           The various games and demos that ship with the R-C4D3 system
scoreserver    A simplistic high score server
shared         Resources used by multiple projects

Within the various subsystems are implementations organized by technology.

All of the following web technologies can be used to create games for the R-C4D3 system:
  ActionScript / Flash / Flex
  Javascript / HTML canvas
  Java / Processing
  Silverlight
  O3d
  X3d
